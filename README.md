# Hey there! 👋

I'm a curious Software Engineer working with Ruby/RoR on a daily basis and with Elixir/Phoenix sometimes. Most of my career was dedicated to front-end development, React and its ecosystem. However, I'm focusing on developing my back-end skills at the moment. Some things about me:

- 👩‍🚀 Functional Programming is awesome! I've been studying Elixir and Phoenix lately.
- 🎨 I want to try TailwindCSS for real someday. The markup and the styles being mixed together is an interesting idea. I also love its versatility, since you can use it regardless of the stack you are working with.
- 🏡 I lived in more places than I can count with my fingers.
- ⌨️ I have a strange hobby, which is [custom mechanical keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomKeyboards).
