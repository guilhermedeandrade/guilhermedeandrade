I'm a curious Software Engineer working with JavaScript daily for around 2 years. Most of this time was dedicated to front-end development, React and its ecosystem. However, I've also worked with Node.js and Ruby on Rails applications.

- 👩‍🚀 Functional Programming is awesome! I've been studying [ReasonML](https://github.com/guilhermedeandrade/ES2077) and [Elixir](https://github.com/guilhermedeandrade/elixir-school) lately
- ⌨️ I have a strange hobby, which is [custom mechanical keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomKeyboards)
